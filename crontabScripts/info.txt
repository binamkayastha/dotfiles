Make suer to do the following things to use crontabScripts for battery
notifications:
 - Put the script files in your home directory
 - Change YOURUSERNAMEHERE into whatever your username is. To find your
   username run the command: echo "echo $USER"
 - Make sure your notify-send works, by running a test command: notify-send
   "test"
Put this in your crontab file:

DISPLAY=:0
XAUTHORITY=/home/binam/.Xauthority
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
*/5 * * * * sh /home/YOURUSERNAMEHERE/crontabScripts/batteryCheck.sh
