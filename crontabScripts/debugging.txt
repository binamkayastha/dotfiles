Make sure to do the following things to use crontabScripts for battery
notifications:

Scripts:
 - Put both the script files in a directory called crontabScripts in your home directory
 - Make sure the scripts have executable permission, do this by running the
   command: chmod +x batteryNotif.sh, and chmod +x batteryCheck.sh
Dependencies:
 - Make sure your notify-send works, by running a test command: notify-send
   "test"
 - Make sure you have acpi, as this is what the scripts check for the
   percentage of you battery left.
